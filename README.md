# Discord Anti DM Advertising SELF BOT

 This is a self bot that will alert the bot owner and staff of your server when they receive a potential DM advertisement!
 
 As I said before, this is a **SELF BOT** and I do NOT take resposnibility for any consequences your account faces for using this code. Self botting is against [Discord TOS](https://discordapp.com/terms). **Use at your own risk!**
 
 That being said, I HIGHLY recommend you use an alternate account to do this with. Just make another user account that looks legit and do it that way so your main account does not get punished. Plus, no one is going to DM advertise to the server owner so you will want to use an account that looks like a normal user. **DO NOT USE THIS ON A BOT ACCOUNT! THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE AND MAKE THIS CODE USELESS.**
 
# Features

**1.** Set a logging channel

**2.** Alerts the bot owner and the server staff when the bot receives a potential DM advertisement

**3.** Shows you the DM message

**4.** Tells you who sent it

# How To Setup

Well first, you will need [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which you can get [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next you need to download this repo as a zip to your desktop and extract it wherever you want.

Then, open the bot files and navigate to the "data" folder. Open the "settings" file and you will see text such as "PUT YOUR SELF BOT TOKEN HERE". You will notice more text like that, you will need to fill in the blanks with your own information.

Finally, if you go back to the main folder directory, you will see a file titled "FIRST TIME SETUP" and "start". Open the "FIRST TIME SETUP" file and let it install the required modules to run this bot. Then run the "start" file to start the bot and you will be all set. 

You can join the server you want this account to watch over and type `!logChannel {#channel-you-want}` and the bot will inform you someone DM messages them.
